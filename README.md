# Financial-Planning-website

I was asked by a friend to think of enabling people to have a way to interact with their financial advisers in a way that 
allowed the client to feel that the meetign was productive in a way that he wanted. My friend felt that, while his financial
adviser was good at her job, the meetings were running at her agenda and not his.

This site is a test to see if I can produce something that informs and gives something practical in the form of a meeting 
agenda, which can be sent to the adviser ahead of time, to allow the client to feel a little in control as well as get a sense
of the meeting being productive.
